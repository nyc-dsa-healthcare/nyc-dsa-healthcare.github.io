## About the NYC DSA Healthcare Working Group

The NYC DSA Healthcare Working Group is a volunteer-run organization fighting for universal healthcare in New York State and across the country.

We campaign to pass the **New York Health Act** — single-payer healthcare that would cover every New Yorker with comprehensive benefits, no premiums, no copays, and no deductibles.

### Our Goals

- Pass the New York Health Act
- Build a mass movement for Medicare for All
- Educate and organize New Yorkers around health justice

### Get Involved

Join us at one of our upcoming events, or reach out via social media.
